Matrix Digital Rain Python
==========================

## Enter the Matrix
A 'just for fun' python console version of the classic [Matrix digital rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain)

## Installation
It's simple to run, just open up a terminal and run the rain.py file - it's set to autorun so that's all you really need to do to enter the Matrix!

```
python3 rain.py
```

## Options
There are a few customisations you can make on instantiation of the Matrix class:

- **screen_width** *default=150* - can be used to change the width of the output in the terminal
- **line_count**   *default=750* - can be used to change the amount of lines
- **line_speed**.  *default=0.1* - how quickly the lines print

### Morpheus
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?
